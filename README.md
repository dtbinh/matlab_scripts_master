# matlab_scripts_master
This repo includes Matlab scripts used in my master theses at NTNU spring 2018.

## openCvCamMat.m
This script converts the results from the Matblab cameraCalibrator 
to a .yaml file. The .yaml file is structured on the form used in the 
OpenCv library.

## landingSimulator.m
This script simulates target tracking of a vehicle using UAV. The Constant bearing Guidance controller is implemented and the results are simulated as an animation.
